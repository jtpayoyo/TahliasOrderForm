# TahliasOrderForm
This is a windows form for the fictitious family-friendly restaurant Tahlia's. This program was created using Windows Forms, C# and .NET Core 3.1 for course work at SAIT. Images were created by me.
To run the program, execute "Payoyo_Jeanne_Lab1.exe" in Payoyo_Jeanne_Lab1/Payoyo_Jeanne_Lab1/bin/debug/netcoreapp3.1
